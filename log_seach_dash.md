## LOGISTICS SEARCHENGINGE DASHBOARD

**Project description:** At the market customers use and are aware only about market references derived from official Excel pricelist. However behind these market references exist internal references that may vary from market reference due to a product version or evolution, slight technical modifications, various assembly plants etc. Thus when a customer place an order, for example for offical material reference "child_bike_18_GR" it has to be translated by special SAP substitution table into "child_bike_18_GR_ver1" which is active for production, sales and so on.
Additionally every market reference may have several internal references with their:
1. product life cycle - design phase, active phase, withdrawal phase, deletion phase and so on (SAP distribution-chain-specific material status)
2. main distribution plant 
3. inventory planner who responsible for avaiability of internal reference for local market


### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
